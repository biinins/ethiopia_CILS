Домашнее задание № 6. VoyantTools

Согласно **Summary** корпуса документов, можно сделать следующие выводы:
- самыми объемными являются корпуса eng (12793), it (12287), ar (10078), jp (8089) и no (7580), а короткими - amh (4349), es (4405), hu (4490), ch (4839) и ru (5768);
- наиболее частотными являются слова ethiopia (1178), ethiopian (645), country (340), government (229) и addis (200) (что страннно, потому что слово addis, скорее всего, должно использвоваться в паре с ababa (addis ababa - наименование столицы), потому что само по себе addis с арабского на английский переводилось бы как "new", но, тем не менее, в данном корпусе текстов оно было использовано в транслитерированной форме)

Вкладка **Terms** демонстрирует нам следующие результаты:
